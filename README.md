The goal of this task was to create a foundational backend using Node.js and Express.
An Express server was initialized and multiple routes were implemented, including basic text, JSON responses, dynamic routing, query parameters processing, and full CRUD functionality for users.
All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) were tested successfully using Postman.
The server works correctly and meets all task requirements.
